# Spotify Clustering with Unsupervised Machine Learning, Additional Algorithms
## Sanskriti Chadha and Ajit Selvakumaran

This project is about using unsupervised machine learning techniques to create similar playlist clusters of Spotify songs based on a 
number of different attributes. Using our Principal Component Analysis, which reduced dimensionality, we explored and implemeneted
three new clustering algorithms: Agglomerative Clustering, BIRCH Clustering, and DBScan Clustering. Run all the cells in order with 
the dataset in the same environment you will be good to go. Any questions can be directed to any of us!

Note: We uploaded a PDF of our code due to the >25MB limit on GitHub.
